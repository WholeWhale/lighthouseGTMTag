# Lighthouse By Whole Whale
This GTM template tag will allow you to install the Lighthouse script with only the variable keys provided by the app. 
To use it: 
* Login to app.getlighthouse.io and from the get embed code section, grab the values from `LH_USER_ID=`, `LH_IDENTITY_ID=`, and `API_KEY=` and place them in the right fields
* set it on the window load trigger for all pages
Make sure you are getting the GA ID as a custom dimension, you can find instructions for that [here](https://www.wholewhale.com/lighthouse/setup/#segments) or use the Lighthouse by Whole Whale custom dimension variable template. 

_**Note**: you will still need to generate the custom dimension in the GA property settings to acquire the index number._
